Last updated: February 14, 2022

This policy applies to the website ([clockwise.bchen.dev](https://clockwise.bchen.dev), also referred to as the “Web App”) as well as the mobile app (referred to as “App”). Both are referred to collectively as the “Services”.

**In short**: All information that you directly input into the services (settings, task information) is stored locally and never sent to a server. Read below for more information on analytics data. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at [smallpigeon1@gmail.com](mailto:smallpigeon1@gmail.com).

## What information is collected?

All data you enter directly through the web app or mobile app (such as task data) is stored locally on your device, and never sent to a server. Therefore, I have no access to that data, and cannot process or share that data.

Currently, I do not collect analytics data through the website or app. If this changes in the future, I will update this privacy policy to state what data is collected.

I may collect your contact information if you directly contact me using any method.

### Use of cookies

The web app uses cookies and local storage to enable offline support, store task information, and store settings information. These are required cookies for functionality and cannot be disabled at this time. If you do not consent to the use of cookies, you should stop using the services and clear cookie data using your browser’s cookie settings.

Cookies are not used to track you or target advertisements to you.

## Will your information be shared with anyone?

I may process or share your data that I hold based on the following legal basis:

Consent: I may use your data if you have given me specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.

Legitimate Interests: I may use your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve legitimate interests. For example, I may use contact information to respond to inquires.

Legal Obligations: I may disclose your information when I am legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable laws and government requests.

## How long do I keep your information?

I will keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice, unless otherwise required by law. If there is no ongoing need to keep your information, I will delete or anonymize such information.

## Updates to this notice

I may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible, unless otherwise indicated on the notice. When changes are made, I may notify you by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
