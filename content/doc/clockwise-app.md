On February 7th, 2023, the Clockwise will no longer be available for download from the App Store or the Google Play store. The web version, hosted at [clockwise.bchen.dev](https://clockwise.bchen.dev) will remain available, and will continue to receive bug fixes and stability improvements.

While the app will not be removed if you already have it installed, I recommend you switch to the web version or look for a different Pomodoro timer app.

I would like to thank you for using the app, and hope that you've found it useful in getting work done.

# Future of the Project

As previously mentioned, the web version will continue to get bug fixes and stability improvements. However, the reality is that I currently don't have the time or bandwidth to continue adding new features, so I'm looking for someone to take over and continue the project. Clockwise has been [open source](https://github.com/brendan-ch/clockwise) for some time now, and I've just updated the licensing to make it easier for people to fork.

If you're interested in doing this, please [contact me](mailto:me@bchen.dev) so I can help with the transition. Thank you in advance!
