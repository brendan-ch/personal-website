# My Roles

## UI Design

![Screenshot of a high-fidelity prototype.](/static/work/clockwise/ui-design.png)

I started with some low-fidelity sketches of the timer, which turned into a high-fidelity prototype. The UI was designed using Figma, and the font used is Anonymous Pro.

As part of adding a minimal amount of distraction to the user's workflow, the rest of the app fades out when the timer is running.

## Mobile App Development

The mobile app was developed using React Native.

## Web App Development

The web app was developed using React Native Web.
