# My Roles

## UI Design

![Frames of a high-fidelity prototype.](/static/work/clockwise/ui-design.png)

I started with some low-fidelity sketches of the timer, which turned into a high-fidelity prototype. The UI was designed using Figma, and the font used is Anonymous Pro.

As part of adding a minimal amount of distraction to the user's workflow, the rest of the app fades out when the timer is running.

## Mobile App Development

The mobile app was developed using React Native with Expo. Features of the app include a minimal interface, timer customization, dark mode, and automatic switching between focus and break modes.

## Web App Development

The web app was developed using React Native Web, starting from the same codebase as the mobile app. Additionally, the web app supports keyboard shortcuts for every possible action, and displays background images retrieved from Unsplash.
