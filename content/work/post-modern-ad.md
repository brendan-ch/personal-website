![Post-Modern Advertisement for a Sony Walkman.](/static/work/post-modern-ad/post-modern-ad.png)

*The poster was created using Adobe InDesign, and the Walkman drawing was created in Excalidraw. Fonts used are Neue Haas Grotesk Display, Franklin Gothic URW, and Flegrei.*

## What is something you are proud of/find successful/you learned from this project?
I think the layout is successful, as well as the choice of typography. I also like how the Walkman I drew as a conceptual draft ended up making it into the final advertisement. I learned to keep trying new ideas and experimenting with different designs.

## With regards to your own poster advertisement: What is something that you would change or think could be improved upon?
I think that I could have done something more interesting with the background of the poster.
