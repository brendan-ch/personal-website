A volunteer project I’m working on with [Techies Without Borders](http://techieswithoutborders.us).

# About the Project

The mission of CMES is to enable medical practitioners in resource-constrained areas to improve patient care, by providing access to cutting-edge medical literature. We currently provide two solutions: a USB drive with content synchronization on-the-go, and CMES-Pi, a Raspberry Pi-based server which provides access to content via web and mobile apps.

Learn more about the project on the [official website](https://cmesworld.org/).

# My Roles

## CMES Mobile App

I’m one of the developers for the CMES mobile app, an integral part of the CMES-Pi solution. The app is the preferred way to access continuing medical education (CME) content on a mobile device, providing medical practitioners with the ability to browse and download content for offline reading and listening.

*The mobile app is built using Capacitor and Ionic Angular, and the CMES-Pi web app is built with PHP.*

## CMES Admin Panel
As part of both USB and CMES-Pi solutions, we use an internal web app that provides administrators with the ability to manage CME content. In addition to working on the web interface, I also work on the backend side to ensure that CME content is uploaded and tagged correctly.
