coffeetype is a minimalistic typing test built with Java Swing, as my final project for AP Computer Science A.

# My Roles

## Logo Design

![Moodboard and color palette.](/static/work/coffeetype/moodboard-and-colors.png)

Based on the moodboard and color palette, I knew I wanted a dark color palette for the app's background. I also tweaked the orange color to better fit the overall aesthetic of the design.

*The font used in the logo is Lexend Deca.*

## UI Design

I started with a couple of concept sketches, and turned two of them into high-fidelity prototypes.

![Second variant of the design.](/static/work/coffeetype/coffeetype-variant-2.png)

I decided to go with the second variant because it was easier to implement, given the limited timeframe of this project.

## Development

For me, the biggest constraint of this project was the requirement of using Java Swing. I made several compromises to the layout and functionality to keep the project moving forwards and on track. For example, I scrapped the leaderboard functionality and other typing modes, as well as the multiplayer functionality.
