coffeetype is a minimalistic typing test built with Java Swing, as my final project for AP Computer Science A.

# My Roles

## Logo Design

I created a moodboard for the logo, using different images of coffee and different logos.

Based on the color palette, I knew I wanted a dark color palette for the app's background.

*The font used in the logo is Lexend Deca.*

## UI Design

I started with a couple of concept sketches, and turned two of them into high-fidelity prototypes.

![Second variant of the design.](/static/work/coffeetype/coffeetype-variant-2.png)

Based on my knowledge of Java Swing, I decided to go with the second variant because it was easier to implement. I was also working within a limited timeframe for this project, which influenced my decision.
